# Introduction

A collection of CI/CD export and import pipeline (which can be done manually) + deployment setting files.

- Natively, power platform also support pipeline but we will use Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline.

Each project will be in its corresponding folder which is named based on `Solution Name`. Each folder will have a `YAML` file for the CI/CD and a deployment setting file.

- The Azure DevOps pipeline we used is a GUI Power Platform Tool but from that tool we can also generate the `YAML` file.

Here is the tutorial for the Azure DevOps export and import pipeline:
